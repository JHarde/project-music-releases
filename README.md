# Music Releases

This is a copy of Spotify, an app we decided to call Mockify. We have built this app with React and gathered all necessary information from the json.
The site is responsive and has some different features depending on what device you're viewing the content in.

## The problem

Initially the hardest part was to map the information about the different artists. But once we were able to map that information everything started to go a bit more
smoothly. We decided that we wanted to divide the content on the page and sort the Albums from the Singles, here using map as well. Towards the end we wanted to add some more features, like a dropdown menu with different playlists on mobile and tablet view, and the same information in desktop view but shown in a different format. The struggles we faced were solved through talking to other team members, gathering information from the internet and through trial and error. For the dropdown menu we tried out to use state for the first time, and we used some components from the reactstrap-library. The reactstrap-library was supposed to be styled with css bootstrap, but we did not use that and styled the dropdown-components ourselves.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
